What is pair trading?
Pair Trading (also known as Statistical Arbitrage) is a market-neutral trading strategy where you trade two correlated stocks by simultaneously going long on one and short on the other when their relative price relationship diverges.

How Does Pair Trading Work?
Find Highly Correlated Pairs

Identify two stocks that typically move together (e.g., Pepsi and Coca-Cola).
Use correlation analysis and cointegration tests to ensure the pair maintains a stable relationship over time.
Measure the Spread Between the Pairs

Calculate the price difference or ratio of the two stocks.
Use Z-score, standard deviations, or moving averages to measure divergence.
Enter a Trade When the Spread Diverges

If Stock A becomes overpriced relative to Stock B:
Short Stock A (overvalued)
Long Stock B (undervalued)
If the spread reverts to the mean, exit the trade for profit.
Exit the Trade When the Spread Normalizes

Close both positions when the spread returns to its historical mean.

Why is Pair Trading Good?
âœ… Market Neutral â€“ Works in bull, bear, or sideways markets.
âœ… Lower Risk â€“ One position hedges the other, reducing exposure.
âœ… Mean-Reverting â€“ Profits when prices return to their historical relationship.
âœ… Well-Suited for Automated Trading â€“ Uses statistical models for trade signals.

âš  Challenges:

Finding Strongly Cointegrated Pairs â€“ Correlation alone isn't enough; cointegration is better.
Execution Timing â€“ Requires frequent rebalancing.

ðŸš€ Final Thoughts
For a trader who only executes once per day, the best approach is to stick to longer trends and avoid strategies that require real-time decisions.

Best Practices for You:
âœ” Run your strategy pre-market or post-market.
âœ” Use sentiment to confirm technical signals.
âœ” Avoid intraday tradingâ€”too much noise.
âœ” Pick one strategy and backtest before trading live.
